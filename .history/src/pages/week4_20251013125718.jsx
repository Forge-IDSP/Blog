                        Project Advisor Meeting
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        We kicked off our week with an amazing email notifying
                        us that we have been assigned a project advisor. Our
                        project advisor is Derek Houg who not only has industry
                        experience in trades but also software development. We
                        got the chance to meet him via zoom , discuss our
                        project idea with him and get very useful feedback. This
                        is the time we remembered that projects like this are
                        not linear, its all about feedback , testing , iterating
                        and changing. So with our project idea not being very
                        viable considering the ability for us to help users by
                        guiding them in creating a business as well.

                        “Mission Idea Brainstorming”

                    <p>
                        We were now on a mission to figure out how to shape
                        forge to become a viable product . So we took the rest
                        of the week to brainstorm ideas and do some research on
                        the challenges that individuals in trades may face.
